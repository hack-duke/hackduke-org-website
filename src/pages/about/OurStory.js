                <h2>"Do Something New"</h2>
                <p>It was 2013, and it started out as HackBlue. A group of 3 Duke and UNC students—Dennis Li, Yang Su, and Katie Hawthorne—organized the first hackathon at Duke to get people excited about learning and creating things outside the classroom.</p>
                <p>The vision? Create the first university hackathon experience in the RTP area in providing a unique learning experience where like-minded and driven students come together and create interesting hacks in 24 hours. The event attracted ~100 students. Later that year, our organization was renamed to HackDuke and continued to grow.</p>
